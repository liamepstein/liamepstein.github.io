        <p>I work on AI governance, focusing on compute policy, export controls, and strategic technology policy. I aim to help governments and institutions manage the risks and opportunities from advanced AI systems.</p>

        <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>I am a researcher working at the intersection of artificial intelligence policy and governance. My research focuses on understanding how technological developments in AI can be effectively governed through policy mechanisms, with particular attention to compute governance, export controls, and strategic technology policy.</p>

        <p>My approach combines technical understanding of AI systems with policy analysis to develop practical recommendations for institutions seeking to navigate the complex landscape of AI governance.</p>

        <h3>Current Projects</h3>
        <p>My current research investigates how compute governance mechanisms can be designed to balance innovation with safety and security concerns. This includes analysis of export control regimes, hardware security measures, and international coordination mechanisms.</p>
